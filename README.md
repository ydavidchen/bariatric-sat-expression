Author: David Chen, Ph.D.

## Introduction

Bariatric surgery is currently the most effective approach to achieve weight loss as an obesity intervention. However, the molecular mechanisms behind bariatric surgery remains elusive, especially given that the existing studies tend to have very small sample sizes. 

## Design
